# **IMDb API**
IMDb API is a backend system for storing and manipulate movie characters.
The application is constructed in Spring using Hibernate. A PostgreSQL database is used
to store information about characters, the movies they appear in, and the franchises
they belong to. The REST API is used to interact and manipulate the data.
